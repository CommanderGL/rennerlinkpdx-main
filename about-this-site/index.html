    <h2>About the Website</h2>
    <p>This website is hosted on Replit free software and was coded entirely from scratch by the creator (me). Using raw code, versus a template or web design service, allowed me freedom and control of both the siteâ€™s design and functionality. With 13 separate linked web pages, this is by far the biggest coding project I have ever completed, and it took a lot of trial-n-error to achieve the final design.</p><br><p>Below is a screenshot of me creating this very page in Replit:</p>
